=========================

This section contains documentation for the Petrophysics module. We indicate the reference (Pt-Br) of :footcite:t:`freire2020youtube` for the methods used in this module.

The combination of analytical validation, vectorized numerical testing, and physics-driven property-based testing results in a research-grade, industrially defensible petrophysical computation framework. This methodology ensures that the library is not only mathematically correct, but also numerically robust, physically realistic, and suitable for both academic research and professional reservoir characterization workflows.
